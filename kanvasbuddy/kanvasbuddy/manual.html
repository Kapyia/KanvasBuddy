        <p>You can change which dockers are featured on KB and the order they appear in by setting and moving the flags in <strong>config.ini</strong>.</p>
        <p>Panel sizes and button icons are possible to edit by changing values in <strong>data.json</strong>. This is discouraged unless you're confident you know what you're doing, though.</p>
